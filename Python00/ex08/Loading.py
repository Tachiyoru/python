__doc__ = """This script implements a simplified version of
    the tqdm progress bar for iteration over a range.

Functions:
- ft_tqdm(lst: range) -> None:
    Displays a progress bar indicating the progress of iteration over
        the given range.
    Prints the progress bar to the console.
    Returns None.

Parameters:
- lst: A range object representing the range over which the
    iteration is performed.

Example Usage:
- Call the ft_tqdm function with a range object as an argument.
- The progress bar will be displayed showing the progress
    of the iteration.

Note:
- This function is a simplified version of the tqdm library's
    progress bar and is intended for basic usage.
- It may not provide all the features or customization
    options available in tqdm.
